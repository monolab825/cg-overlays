# What is CG Overlays?
It adds overlays to the Codingame IDE to help you solve their programming challenges.

## How to use?

1. Your bot `print to stderr` special instructions.
2. Extension parses them and `draw` them over standard game visualizer.

Each instruction should be on a separate line and have the following format: 
```
@[instructionName] [instructionArgs]

or

![instructionName] [instructionArgs]
```

Instruction marked with ! will be executed every frame starting from the frame it was issued.

The following instructions are supported (all @-instructions can be used as !-instructions):

#### Rectangles

- `@r [color] [left] [top] [right] [bottom]` draws a rectangle without fill.
- `@fr ...` draws filled rectangle.
- `@tr ...` draws a rectangle with semitransparent fill.

#### Circles

- `@c [color] [x] [y] [radius]` draws a circle without fill.
- `@fc ...` draws a filled circle.
- `@tc ...` draws a circle with semitransparent fill.

#### Line paths

- `@l [color] [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2] ...` draws a lines path.
- `@fl ...` draws a lines path and fill internals.
- `@tl ...` draws a lines path and fill internals with semitransparent.

#### Grids

- `!grid [gridId] [nRows] [nCols] [left] [top] [cellWidth] [cellHeight]` - define grid, draws nothing.
- `@fgrid [color] [gridId] [cell1] [cell2] ...` - fill grid cells with numbers cell1, cell2, ... Cell (x, y) has number x + nCols*y.
- `@lgrid [color] [gridId] [cell1] [cell2] ...` - draws a line path through center of cells.
- `@fcell [color] [gridId] [col] [row]` - fill grid cell with specified coordinates in the grid.

#### Text
- `@txt [color] [left] [bottom] [fontSize] [text]` draws a text. Font size is for 800px width canvas, for other canvas sizes font will be rescaled.
- `@font [font-name]` sets font for @txt.

#### GameParameters
For some [known games](extension/knownGames.js) you do not need these instructions. But if something is not working - use them!

- `!game [gameName]` sets game name. Some known games can't be detected by extension. You should help it to recognize game with this instruction (OceanOfCode, GameOfDrones, ...).
- `!game [gameName] [width] [height]` sets game name and size of game field for games with varying field size (e.g. CodeOfKutulu).
- `!stepEveryFrame` may be needed for some games. In some turn based games visualizer steps on every frame, not only on keyframes. So you need this instruction to sync steps in visualizer.
- `!vp [logicalFieldWidth] [logicalFieldHeight] [screenFieldLeft] [screenFieldTop] [screenFieldRight]` sets the viewport. See below.
- `!o [opacity]` sets global opacity (in range 0 .. 1.0) for overlay canvas.

### How to use vp instruction?

`!vp [logicalFieldWidth] [logicalFieldHeight] [screenFieldLeft] [screenFieldTop] [screenFieldRight]`

`logicalFieldWidth` and `logicalFieldHeight` - logical width of the field in game units, as specified in the statements.

All other three parameters â€” screen coordinates of the field rectangle if total screen width is resized to 16000.
To find this coordinates you can click on the visualizer, hold CTRL-key and move mouse pointer to the field corners.
You will see coordinates in the top-left corner of the visualizer.

For example, for OceanOfCode you can use `!vp 15 15 4270 770 11730` instruction:

- 15x15 cells field (for grid game, the cell size equal to 1 recommended).
- In the top-left corner of the field `4270 770` will be shown.
- In the top-right corner of the field `4270 11730` will be shown.

### Coordinates 

All other coordinates are logical coordinates, as in the game rules.

### Colors

Color can be specified in CSS color format (but no spaces please!). Some examples:
`#FF0000`, `rgb(0,255,255)`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`, `red`.

Wrong color format will not be reported, but will be ignored.

## Errors checking

Syntax errors will be reported on the BSOD :)

### Sample stderr output

```

@fr red 0 0 1000 1000
@r #00FFFF 1000 0 2000 1000

@l white 8000 5000 10000 5000 9000 4000 8000 5000
@fl green 3000 5000 5000 5000 4000 4000 3000 5000
@c red 8000 5000 1000
@fc rgba(255,255,0,0.3) 8000 5000 500
@tc blue 10000 1000 500
@tc blue 10500 1200 500
@font monospace
